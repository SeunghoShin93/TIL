 Any code inside the main() method will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

 For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.
 */
public class HelloWorld { // HelloWorld == filename

	/**
	 * @param args
	 * 
	 */
	
	public static void main(String[] args) { // every program must contain the main() method.
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("Hello JAVA!!!");
	}

}
